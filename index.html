<p>Users of this program have a protected space to communicate with each other. Entrance into the application's functionality 
          requires authentication and there are shared passwords between users for the messages they send as added 
          security.</p>

<h3>
<a id="designer-templates" class="anchor" href="#designer-templates" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>How it Works</h3>

<p>SQLite3 provided the back-end for this application. For authentication, usernames were stored and passwords were stored as hashes with
         an implementation of SHA256. For every new user, a random salt was generated to use in the password hash, and this was
          stored in the database in plain text. For messaging, the usernames involved and random salts generated were stored
          in plain text. The messages were stored in the database in an encrpyted form. This was the result of XOR-ing the 
          original message with a stream cipher generated based on a hashed password that the two users involved agree on. This
          password is never stored in any form in the back-end. If the password is incorrect, XOR-ing the stream cipher generated from the incorrect
          password with the encrypted message will not produce the original message. But if it is right, a user can type in the password
          for a message and decrpyt it so it can be read. Then, a user could respond to that message or write to a new user. For
          higher security, users should use different passwords for different messages.</p>

<p>The Input Output (FIO) and Error Handling (ERR) rules and recommendations were weighed in the design and programmatic stages of this project.
          In secure coding review, code was evaluated by all SEI CERT C/C++ Coding Standards to determine its strengths and vulnerabilities.</p>
